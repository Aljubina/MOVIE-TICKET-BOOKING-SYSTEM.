# Movie Ticket Booking System

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub import of a Movie Ticket Booking System repository. However, the imported repository is essentially empty and contains only documentation files.

## Current State
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Aljubina/MOVIE-TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM
- **Contents**: Only README.md and LICENSE files
- **Code Status**: No implementation code present
- **Language Intent**: Python (based on .gitignore)

## What's Available
- README.md: Brief description stating "Web Based Movie booking System"
- LICENSE: Project license file
- .gitignore: Python-specific ignore patterns (suggests intended Python implementation)

## Next Steps
The repository appears to be a placeholder without actual implementation. To create a functional movie ticket booking system, the project would need to be built from scratch or the correct repository with the actual code would need to be imported.
